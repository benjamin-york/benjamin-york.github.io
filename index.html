    <p> My name is Benjamin York, and I am Visiting Assistant Professor at Skidmore College. My area of interest is computational arithmetic geometry, and my current focus is on the computation of images of Galois representations attached to elliptic curves with CM. I received my Ph.D. in May 2025 from the University of Connecticut. My advisor was
